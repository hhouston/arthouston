### Technologies & Technical Challenges

This website will be implemented using Ruby on Rails and ReactJS. The database will run on PostgreSQL while the front end will utilize JavaScript, JSX, jBuilder, HTML, and SASS.

In addition to the existing technology the Stripe API will be used for payment processing.

The primary technical challenges will be:

- Secure sign up and protection of user payment information
- Tracking and processing orders to be 100% bug free for a good user experience
- Enticing UI and adequate design to impress art lovers
- Mobile first design using media queries
